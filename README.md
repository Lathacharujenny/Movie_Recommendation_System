## Overview
This project is a **Content-Based Product Recommendation System** built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The system analyzes product data and recommends similar products to users based on their preferences. The recommendation logic is implemented using **cosine similarity** to measure the similarity between product features.

## Dataset
The project uses a product dataset containing details such as 
1. index – the serial number
2. product – Title (or name) of the product
3. category – Category of the product
4. sub_category – Subcategory of the product
5. brand – Brand of the product
6. sale_price – Price at which product is being sold on the site
7. market_price – The market price of the product
8. type – Type into which product falls
9. rating – aggregate product rating (out of 5) by customers
10. description – Description of the product

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Imported and cleaned the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and analyzed data distributions and trends.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Processed text features (e.g., product descriptions) for similarity calculation.
4. **Cosine Similarity**: Computed cosine similarity to find products similar to the target product.
5. **Content-Based Recommendations**: Displayed a list of recommended products based on the similarity score.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
ook. The system analyzes product data and recommends similar products to users based on their preferences. The recommendation logic is implemented using **cosine similarity** to measure the similarity between product features.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explored and analyzed product data for meaningful insights.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used cosine similarity to identify and recommend products.
- **Interactive Implementation**: Code and outputs are presented in an easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook format.
